An indexed columnâ€™s data is stored in a separate location known as the index. The data is ordered according to type (for example numeric, alphabetical or date order). Each piece of data in the index points to the original table row. By creating a relationship, or reference, between the index and table, it becomes easier and faster to search for data.
