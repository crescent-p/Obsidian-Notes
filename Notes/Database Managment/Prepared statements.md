A query must be parsed by MySQL before it can be executed, which takes time and causes delays.

However, creating prepared statements in MySQL reduces the parsing time for queries. A prepared statement only needs to be parsed by MySQL once, regardless of the number of times it’s used and executed.

A prepared statement in MySQL is a template that you create with an SQL statement. A prepared statement starts with a PREPARE command followed by the statement name. This can be a custom name. It can also include certain unspecified values, used as parameters and labelled with a question mark ?

For example, in the following syntax, the two question marks ? represent two parameters that can be used to insert two different values into the Products table:

`PREPARE InsertProductData FROM ‘INSERT INTO Products VALUES(?, ?)’;`

==Creating prepared statements also secures your database from SQL injections, a common hacking technique that can be used to destroy your database. A SQL injection attempts to pass malicious code to your database through SQL statements. However, this can be avoided if you use prepared statements when building your SQL queries.==
