```
python -m venv <name>
source <name>/bin/activate
deactivate
```

why virtual env?

	handling different version of same libraries across different projects.

Also you need to change the default interpreter to the venv one.
Go to view->command palette and change interpreter to 
` <name>/bin/python 3.10 `
