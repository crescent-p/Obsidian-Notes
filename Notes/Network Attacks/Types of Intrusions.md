Intrusions can compromise your system in several ways, depending on the method used by the attacker. Here are some common types of intrusions and how they can compromise your system:

### 1. **Malware**
- **Description**: Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.
- **Compromise**:
  - **Viruses**: Infect and replicate on systems, potentially corrupting or deleting data.
  - **Worms**: Spread across networks, consuming bandwidth and potentially installing backdoors.
  - **Trojan Horses**: Disguised as legitimate software, they can create backdoors, steal data, or allow remote control.
  - **Ransomware**: Encrypts files and demands a ransom for decryption.

### 2. **Phishing**
- **Description**: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity.
- **Compromise**:
  - **Credentials Theft**: Obtains usernames, passwords, or financial information.
  - **Account Compromise**: Uses stolen credentials to access systems and data.

### 3. **Social Engineering**
- **Description**: Manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information.
- **Compromise**:
  - **Unauthorized Access**: Gaining access to systems by tricking employees.
  - **Data Breach**: Extracting sensitive information through deceptive means.

### 4. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**
- **Description**: Using weaknesses in software or hardware to gain unauthorized access.
- **Compromise**:
  - **Remote Code Execution**: Running malicious code on a target system.
  - **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher access rights to execute unauthorized actions.

### 5. **Brute Force Attacks**
- **Description**: Attempting to gain access by systematically trying all possible passwords.
- **Compromise**:
  - **Account Compromise**: Successfully guessing passwords to access accounts.
  - **Denial of Service**: Locking out legitimate users after too many failed attempts.

### 6. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**
- **Description**: Intercepting and altering communication between two parties.
- **Compromise**:
  - **Data Interception**: Capturing sensitive information such as login credentials.
  - **Data Manipulation**: Altering the content of communications.

### 7. **SQL Injection**
- **Description**: Inserting malicious SQL queries into input fields to manipulate databases.
- **Compromise**:
  - **Data Breach**: Extracting sensitive information from databases.
  - **Data Manipulation**: Modifying or deleting database entries.

### 8. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **Description**: Injecting malicious scripts into webpages viewed by users.
- **Compromise**:
  - **Session Hijacking**: Stealing session cookies to impersonate users.
  - **Data Theft**: Extracting information from users' browsers.

### 9. **Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**
- **Description**: Overloading a system with traffic to make it unavailable.
- **Compromise**:
  - **Service Disruption**: Rendering systems or services inaccessible to legitimate users.
  - **Resource Exhaustion**: Consuming bandwidth, CPU, or memory resources.

### 10. **Insider Threats**
- **Description**: Threats originating from within the organization.
- **Compromise**:
  - **Data Theft**: Employees stealing sensitive information.
  - **Sabotage**: Disgruntled employees damaging systems or data.

### Prevention and Mitigation
- **Regular Software Updates**: Patch vulnerabilities promptly.
- **Strong Authentication**: Use multi-factor authentication.
- **Network Security**: Implement firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems.
- **User Education**: Train users to recognize phishing and social engineering attacks.
- **Access Controls**: Restrict user permissions based on roles.
- **Regular Backups**: Ensure data can be restored in case of compromise.
- **Security Audits**: Regularly review and test security measures. 

By understanding these intrusion methods and implementing appropriate security measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of system compromise.
