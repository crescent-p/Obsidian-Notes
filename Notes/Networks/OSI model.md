The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network communication between different systems. It divides the communication process into seven distinct layers, each with specific functions and protocols. This model helps standardize networking protocols to allow interoperability between different hardware and software systems.

### The Seven Layers of the OSI Model

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**
   - **Function**: Handles the transmission of raw binary data over a physical medium, such as cables, switches, and wireless signals.
   - **Components**: Cables (Ethernet, fiber optic), switches, hubs, network interface cards (NICs), connectors.
   - **Protocols**: None specifically, as it deals with hardware and physical transmission.

2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**
   - **Function**: Provides node-to-node data transfer and handles error detection and correction from the physical layer. It also manages MAC (Media Access Control) addresses.
   - **Components**: [[Switches]], [[bridges]].
   - **Protocols**: Ethernet, PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol), HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control), ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).

3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**
   - **Function**: Manages the delivery of packets across multiple networks. It handles logical addressing (IP addresses) and routing through routers.
   - **Components**: Routers, Layer 3 switches.
   - **Protocols**: IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**
   - **Function**: Provides end-to-end communication, ensuring data is transferred reliably and accurately. It handles error correction, data flow control, and segmentation.
   - **Components**: None specifically, as it is a layer within the host devices.
   - **Protocols**: [[Networks/TCP]] (Transmission Control Protocol), [[UDP]] User Datagram Protocol).

5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**
   - **Function**: Manages sessions or connections between applications. It handles the establishment, maintenance, and termination of communication sessions.
   - **Components**: None specifically, as it is a layer within the host devices.
   - **Protocols**: NetBIOS, RPC (Remote Procedure Call), PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol).

6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**
   - **Function**: Translates data between the application layer and the network format. It handles data encryption, compression, and translation.
   - **Components**: None specifically, as it is a layer within the host devices.
   - **Protocols**: SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security), JPEG, MPEG, ASCII, EBCDIC.

7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**
   - **Function**: Provides network services directly to applications. It supports end-user processes and interfaces directly with software applications to provide communication functions.
   - **Components**: None specifically, as it is a layer within the host devices.
   - **Protocols**: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, DNS, Telnet, SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol).

### Key Concepts

- **Encapsulation**: Data is wrapped with protocol information at each layer, with each layer adding its own header (and sometimes trailer) before passing it to the next layer.
- **Decapsulation**: The reverse process of encapsulation, where the data is unwrapped at each layer as it moves up the OSI model on the receiving end.
- **PDU (Protocol Data Unit)**: The form that data takes at each layer, such as bits at the Physical Layer, frames at the Data Link Layer, packets at the Network Layer, and segments at the Transport Layer.

### Summary

The OSI model provides a universal set of standards and guidelines for network communication, ensuring different systems can work together seamlessly. By dividing the networking process into seven layers, the OSI model helps in understanding and troubleshooting network issues, developing network technologies, and ensuring interoperability between various hardware and software systems.
