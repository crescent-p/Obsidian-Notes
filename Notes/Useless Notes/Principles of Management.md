# Classical Management theory
	- evolved around 19th centuary
	- developed around the time of industrical revolution to address the problems arising around machines
	- believed employees only cared about money and physical needs
	- doesnt take into emotional needs
	- focused on specialization of labour, central leadership and profit maximisation
	- three branches
		- taylorism (scietific management)
		- fayolism (administrive principles)
		- bureaucratic organization
	- common assumpoiton
		- employees in work place act in rational way
		- employees primarly driven by monetary needs
## Scientific Management Theory
	- also know as taylorism
	- developed by Frederick Taylor
	- taylor was working as a machinist when he developed this
	- focused on incresein individual producitvity and hence total productivity
	- increased individual efficiency by
		- training workers
		- dividing task between workers and mangers
		- eliminitaing unnecessary movement in the workplace
	- Fundamental principles
		- replaced rules of thumb with scientific methods
		- obtainging harmony rather than discord in group actions
		- maximise output rather than restricted output
		- developing the individual to his fullest for the benefit of him and the company
	- analyse problem (JOB) and find best way to do it
	- division of labour
	- presence of supervisors
	- workers are selected based on skill
	- wages as per productivity and incentives
	- improve tools and working conditins for max prod. with minimum cost
	- ADVANTAGES OF TAYLORISM
		- improved efficiency and productivity
		- assigned workers to positions based on skill
		- only one right method to do things
		- division of job between manageers and employees
	- CRITICISM AGAINST TAYLORISM
		- doesn't create a sense of responsibilty in workers and doesn't push decision making to all levels of organization
		- front line workers need to be very flexible to changing rules-driven production floor and may struggle to adjust.
		- focuses too much on mechanics of the production floor and fails to address human values and needs
