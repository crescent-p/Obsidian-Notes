# Classical Management theory
	- evolved around 19th centuary
	- developed around the time of industrical revolution to address the problems arising around machines
	- believed employees only cared about money and physical needs
	- doesnt take into emotional needs
	- focused on specialization of labour, central leadership and profit maximisation
	- three branches
		- taylorism (scietific management)
		- fayolism (administrive principles)
		- bureaucratic organization (weber)
	- common assumpoiton
		- employees in work place act in rational way
		- employees primarly driven by monetary needs
## Scientific Management Theory
	- also know as taylorism
	- developed by Frederick Taylor
	- taylor was working as a machinist when he developed this
	- focused on incresein individual producitvity and hence total productivity
	- increased individual efficiency by
		- training workers
		- dividing task between workers and mangers
		- eliminitaing unnecessary movement in the workplace
	- Fundamental principles
		- replaced rules of thumb with scientific methods
				- Invovled investigation of work-study and incorporting best performing methods with each other eliminating inffeciencies in the work place.
		- Woker and mangeer should realize that bothe are important in what they do.
		- there should be cooperation between management and workers.
			- management should be open to suggestions from workers and reward them for suggestions that decrease cost of production
			- workers shouldn't go on protest with unreasonable requests.
		- obtainging harmony rather than discord in group actions
		- maximise output rather than restricted output
		- developing the individual to his fullest for the benefit of him and the company
			- selection of employees should be scientific, efficient employeed produce more and earn more
	- analyse problem (JOB) and find best way to do it
	- division of labour
	- presence of supervisors
	- workers are selected based on skill
	- wages as per productivity and incentives
	- improve tools and working conditins for max prod. with minimum cost
	- ADVANTAGES OF TAYLORISM
		- improved efficiency and productivity
		- assigned workers to positions based on skill
		- only one right method to do things
		- division of job between manageers and employees
	- CRITICISM AGAINST TAYLORISM
		- doesn't create a sense of responsibilty in workers and doesn't push decision making to all levels of organization
		- front line workers need to be very flexible to changing rules-driven production floor and may struggle to adjust.
		- focuses too much on mechanics of the production floor and fails to address human values and needs
	- PROBLEMS
		  - workers were often not paid enough for their work
		  - mangagers think work do philosophy became popular
		  - separated workers from greater menaing of thier job
		  - deskilled employees beacuse of specialisation and made them expendable
		  - "survival of the fittest"  = harsh working conditions
		  - employee burnout, dehumanistaion , mental anguish
		  - front line workers need to be flexible to a rapidly changing, rigid, rule-driven production floor.

## Bureaucratic management
	- proposed by Max Weber
	- Bureaucratic management theory
	- Considered as founder of sociology
	- german sociologist, historian, political economist
	- Weber saw in orgs
		- Authority - most workplaces used relationships, kinships and customs
		- favourims - people were hired/fired based on color, race, family. Non-org related matters
	- Weber wanted
		- Orgs should act rationally
		- Clear rules for decision making
		- authority sits with position not person
		- hierarchy should have leagal-rational authority
	- Org is well structured
	- proper chain of command 
	- set rules and regulations
	- communication and decision making are formalised
	- characteristics
		- hierarchianl management structure
		- division of labour
			- specialisation
			- clear defintion of authority and responsibility
		- formal selection process
			-  no nepotism, purely based on skill and qualification
		- career orientation
			- management is different from ownership
			- protection from arbitrary dismissal
		- formal rules and regualtions
			- managers must follow org rules in employee relations
		- impersonality (treating everyone as same)
	- CRITCISM
		- ideal bureaucracy non-existing, someone will try to take advantage
		- RED TAPE : over emphasis on structure and rules will prevent action
		- IRON CAGE : too much emphasis on efficiency and control - inhibits personal freedom
## Administrative management ( Fayolism )
	- proposed by Henri Fayol
	- french mining engineer
	- Father of Modern Management
	- 6 Activities of Industry
		- Technical
		- Commercial 
		- Security
		- Financial 
		- Accounting
		- Managerial
			- planning
			- organising
			- controlling
			- co-ordinating
			- commanding
					- 3 C O P
	- 14 Principles of Mangemnt
		- divison of work
			- work must be divided between different people based on qualification
		- authority and responsibility
			- right of superiors to get exactness from subordiantes
			- managers exercise power and authority, but must bear responsibility for work too.
		- discipline
			- subordinates must respect authority of superiors
		- unity of command
			- each subordinate recieves command from a singel
		- unity of direction
			- people under the same objective or task should have the same manager
		- subordination
			- organisation - bigger than individual, org preference above individuals
		- remuneration
			- must be paid for the work people do, fair, reasonable, and rewarding of the work they do
		- centralisation and decentralisation
			- centralisation -> degree to which subordinates are included in the decision making process
		- scalar chain 
			- from lower to higher in the hierarchy
			- can opt for gang-plank (communicating with same level of) in case there is delay in communication with upper hierarchy
		- order
			- arrangement of things
			- things -> material order, people -> scalr order based on rank in organisation
		- equity
			- kindness and equity
		- esprit de corps
			- team spirit
		- initiative
				- eagerness to initiate action without asking
		- stability of tenure of personnel
	# CRITICISM
	- management oriented, doesn't give much attention to workers
	- some ideas borrowed from military management, fayole prefereed commanding rather than directing
	- mechanical : doesn't include motivating, communication or leading
# Neoclassical 
	- Classical theory limitations
		- people side of the org was not considered
		- people don't always act rationally
		- couldn't achieve efficiency and harmony
	- addressed the physical and social aspects of worker
	- popular after WW1 
	- hawthorne experiments
	- Elton Mayo - Father of Human relations movement
	- HAWTHORNE Experiments
			- studied human behaviour at work places
		- Illumination experiment
			- to determine the effect of lighting in work place
			- found no correlation
		- Relay assembly test room
			- to study effect of working hours, rest periods, wage incentives on output
			- socio-phycological factors affect productivity
		- Mass interview program
			- phase1 - directed interview
				- workers response was guarded
			- phase2 - non-directed interview
				- conversation instead on interview, listening rather than asking
			- appreciation, informal relations affected productivity
		- Bank wiring test room
			- to study social effects on reduced output
			- groups formed own standards
				- reduced output
				- higher performing individuals were orstracised, harrased
			- informal groups - important role in orgs.
		- TWO MAIN OBSERVATIONS
			- experimenter effect
				- making changes was percieved as managers caring, good for morale, productivity
			- social effect
				- being separated from group and giving priority/special treatment created bond and sense of belief
		- people's work satisfaction in not only dependent on monetary gains and physical needs but also societal status, emotional fullfillment, inclusivity at work place, sense of being heard and much more 
		- Every group develops its own customs, haits and expectation of how things should be done. This will affect the productivity. It could have a postive or negative impact depending on situation.
## Human relations approach
	- focus on the behaviour of people in groups
	- focus on the effect of social relations, motivations and employee satisfaction on factory productivity.
	- workers are dealt with their psychology and their fit whithin the company
	- need for reciprocal communication
	- development of high quality leadership
	- power of natural groups
	#CRITICISM
	- lack of scientific validity
	- over emphasis on groups
	- over-streching on human relations
	- limited focus on work
	- over stress on socio-psycological factors
	- negative view on conflict between organisational and individual goals.
## Behavioral  Movement
	- mature version of human realations approach
	- workers are humand not machines
	- understanding human behaviour at work improves productivity
	- tell how managers should reward employees
	- workers are the backbone of the company
	- management should spend time with workers reward them and motivate them
	- Important observations
		- human needs are never satisfied
		- human actions are purposefull, motivated and aimed at achieving satisfaction
		- Needs -> hierarchial struture of importance
## Elements of Neo-Classical Theory
	- Individual
		- recognised the individual differences
			- individual has emotions, feelings, aspirations, hopes, expectations etc.
	- Work group
		- social being -> desire to be accepted in social groups
## Modern management theories
	- worker doesn't work for just money, but satisfaction happiness and good lifestyle
	- Operations research - mathematical technique for modelling, analysing and solving management problems.
	- Management science approach aka quantitative measurement approach sees management as a logical entity, the action of which can be expressed in terms of mathematical symbols, realtionships and measurement data.
### Empirical or Case approach
	- studies experience through cases
	- trie to find out why a certain method failed or succeded
	- limited value in developing management theory
### Managerial Roles Approach
	- Interpersonal
		- figurehead
			- represents the company in public meetings, occasions
		- leader 
			- builds enthusiasm, motivation and leads the employees, training subordinates to work under pressure
		- liaison
			- connecting to groups outside the organisation
	- Informational
		- recepient
			- recieves information from outiside the org
		- disseminator
			- transmits information recieved from other employees to memebers of the organisation
		- spokesperson
			- transmits information to outside the organisation on behalf of the oraganisation.
	- Decision
		- negotiator
			- negotiates with subordiantes, groups and subordinates both internal and external
		- disturbance-handler
			- takes corrective action during crisis or breakdowns, resolve conflict among subordinates
		- resource allocator
			- distribution of resource among individuals and groups in an organisation
		- entrepreneurial
			- acts as a catalyst for innovating new ideas and pitching them to relevant members of the organisation.
	- LIMITATIONS
		- some activites are not managerial
		- original smaple was small
### Contingency or situational approach
	- organisation - collection of interrelated parts
	- management should adapt to situational demands
	- managers should be creative and come up with different solutions to differnt situations
	- CRITICISM
		- managers should know all course of action
		- does not have a strong theoretical base
		- ad-hoc approach
### Management Science Approach
	- mathematical or quantitative approach
	- purely logical analysis
	- using computer tech
	- many models cant be modelled though
	- decision making using math techniques
### Decision theory approach
	- manager -> decision maker
	- organisation -> decison making unit
	- incresing efficiency -> better quality decisions
	- focus -> too narrow or too wide
### Re-Engineering approach
	- fundamental redesign, radical rethinking of business process
	- neglects customers and external factors
### Systems approach
	- organisations are open-systmes

![[Pasted image 20250203181056.png]]

	- organised sysmtes depends on external environment
	- organisation should take input from external environment and convert it into output
	- mangaerial functions should take part in tranformation part
	- open system means there is interaction between organisation and external environment
	- INPUTS
		- Inputs	
			- human, captical, tech etc.
			- employees, consumers, suppliers, stockholders.
		- How managers transform the product
			- planning
			- organising
			- staffing 
			- leading
			- controlling
		- outputs
			- product
			- services
			- satisfaction
			- profits
			- goal integration
		- Communication system
			- objectives set in planning are communicated
			- crucial in appraisal, training, and selection
			- links enterprise with external organisations
		- Reenegising the system
			- some output becomes the input
			- suplus profit is reinvested
			- profound employee information

		# ADVANTAGES
		- assists in studying functions of complex orgs
		- probabilistic rather than deterministic
		- inter-relations in various managerial functions
		# LIMITATIONS
		- somewhat abstract and vague
		- difficult to apply to large oraganizations
		- doesn't address power and social inequalities 
		- does not specify nature of interactions and interdependencies
### Sociotechnical systems approach
		- relates technical systems with social systems
		- focuses on areas with close relation between techinal systems and people
### Group behavior approach
	- study of large groups
	- primarily studies group behaviour pattern
	- not integrated with management principles, concepts and techniques
### Interpersonal Behavior approach
	- based on individual psycology, human realaion, motivation and leadership.
	- ignore planning, organising and controlling
	- psycological training not enough for an effective manager
### McKinsey's 7s Framework
	- hard elements
		- skill
		- shared values
		- staff
	- soft 
		- style
		- system
		- struture
		- strategy
	- create economic value that also creates social values
	- connect companies succes with social progress
### Total quality management approach
	- quality
		- feature and attributes
		- absence of deficiencies
	- long-term success - customer satisfaction
	- all members participate to improve the quality of processe, products, services, culture etc.
	- depends on feedback system

![[Pasted image 20250203223405.png]]

	- management functions are universal
	- draws from all the other theories
	- central core: planning organising staffing directing controlling

## Characteristics of management
	- Continous process
		- planning, organising, activating, controlling the resources
		- absence of basic functions -> no results
	- management is a discipline 
		- continous discovery of business aspects -> passes knowledge to practitioners -> increased status as a discipline
	- applied science
	- universal
	- goal oriented
	- guidence
		- to those who perfrom diverse and specific jobs
	- divorced from proprietorship
	- an activating factor
	- management is a human activity
A manager is someone who carries out the management process within an organization to achieve the organizational goals.

		- reduces creativity
		- may not work in dynamic environment
	-- setting objectives -> developing premises -> identifying alternate courses of action -> evaluating the alternate courses -> selecting an alternative -> implementing the plan -> follow-up action
		- single use plan
		- standing plans (developed once modified from time to time)

	- strategic planning
		- orgs state after 3, 5, 10 years
		- develop long term strategies
		- requires multi-level involvemnt 
	- Tactical planning
		- 6 months to 2 years

		- 
	- staffing
	- leading (directing)
	- controlling

		- shoudl be compatible with oragisational purpose
	- leader
		- convice followers taht they are worthy of being followed
		- should have idead about whta follower can do, their abilities
	- follower
	- importance of leadership
		- build work environmnet
