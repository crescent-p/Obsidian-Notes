•A Market is a place where the exchange of goods takes place. The market is the nervous system of modern economic life where producers and consumers carry out the sale and purchase transactions.
Essentials or Characteristics of a Market:
	Area, commodity and competition
## Market Structure
	number of buyers and sellers. one = monopoly , many = perfect competition
	Nature of the commodity. homogenous porduct same price but heterogenous or no other subsitute means high price.
	Freedom of movement of firms: entry and exit. No fear of competition if entry is limited.
	Knowledge of market conditions: If consumers are aware of all selling prices. Then they can get a more fair price.
	Mobility of goods and factors of production: land labour and captial. If movement is not free. different prices for differnt areas.

Perfect Competion

Imperfect competition
	Monopoly
	Monopoly competition
	Oligopoly

# Perfect  Competition.

Large number of buyers and sellers. No single person has power.
price takers. sets a production level based on the market price.
Identical products. no brand names or differentiation possible.
Price = point at which market demand curve meets market supply curve.
perfectly competitve firm can sell any amount of product at the market price.
free entry and exit. no gov rules and regulation, start up cost.
perfect knowledge. sellers price, no secret techonological advantage, no firm can produce goods faster, cheaper or bettter.
makes normal profits in the long run but can make abnormal profits in the short run

the firm can only alter its output volume and nothing else.
demand curve horizontal (price vs demand) price constant regardless of demand.

# Revenue Concepts

	AR, MR, TR

average revenue = revenue/products sold
marginal revenue = additional revenue gained per product or change in total revenue per additional product sold
total revenue = sum of all revenue received from a product
MARGIN means extra gained. 
# Industry demand curve vs firm demand curve

industry demand curve slopes right to left but firm demand curve is horizontal, since the increase in production of a single firm doesnt affect the market.
for perfect competition price = marginal revenue.
AR = MR = price = Demand in a perfect competition

# Profit maximization by a competitive Firm

revenue = price * product sold
Profit = revenue - cost of production
select an output level that maximizes difference between revenue and cost.

slope of revenue curve = marginal revenue
slope of cost curve = marginal cost

at lower levels of output the profit is negative due to fixed cost (costs that doesn't change with # of products produced) and variable costs (increases with number of products produced).

Total cost = fixed cost + variable cost

at maximum profit level marginal cost = marginal revenue (AB) notice the slopes are equal

# short run equilibrium under perfect competition

## super normal profits

MC = MR and marginal cost curve cuts marginal revenue curve from under. 

avg revenue > avg cost 
==profit = revenue - cost==                                                                          ![[Pasted image 20241113212257.png]]

market price here is P and Short term marginal cost (SMC cuts it at point Q1)
here the cost of production is B. so anything above that is extra profit.

## Normal profits

### AR = MR = market price 
![[Pasted image 20241113212619.png]]

everything meets at a single point.
MC = MR = AR = AC.


# Loss 

revenue only covers the average variable cost. The firm wont close down in this situtation. Because then it would need to pay fixed costs, even without producing any products.

AR >= AVC but AR < AC
![[Pasted image 20241113213139.png]]

Here loss is FGPE. and anything below P is considered shut-down point.

**Why SMC Hits AVC at Market Price** 
- In perfect competition, the market price PP equals the firm’s **average revenue (AR)** and **marginal revenue (MR)**.
- For profit maximization (or loss minimization) in perfect competition, firms produce where **MR = MC** (or **AR = MC**).

In the short run due to inability to enter or exit firms can make supernormal profit, normal profit, minimizing loss, maximize loss or shut down

In the long run firms have the opportunity to exit and enter. So they can make only normal profit in the long run. 

If in long run there is abnormal profits, it will attract new firms and drive production up and conversely price down until it reaches the minimum point of AC curve.
In abnormal loss, inefficient firms are going to quit the market and drive production down and prices up.


# Monopoly 

Single seller. 
	Causes: exclusive access to raw materials, technical knowledge patent rights, size of market, gov barrier for foriegn firms. limit-price policy, heavy advertising, continuous product differentiation.

1)  Simple monopoly - same price across
2)  Discriminating monopoly -> diff prices in diff markets
3) pure monopoly -> no other substitute
4)  impure monopoly -> some substitutes exist 
5) natural monopoly -> India's mica production and Canadas nickel production
6) legal monopoly -> patents, copyrights 
7) industrial/public monopoly -> arms and ammunition, atomic energy, railways and air transport

### Average revenue and marginal revenue

# short term profit
	when margnal revenue is negarive revenue is decreasing.
	
![[Pasted image 20241114030543.png]]	
	
	When the demand curve is downward sloping the marginal revenue is lower than average revenue. So for increase in single unit of product the total price falls, since all are sold at same price and the newer product makes less than the average product.
	
![[Pasted image 20241114030757.png]]

Monopolist has to decide the quantity or prices he want to sell, but not both.

Price discrimination :
	Market divide into submarkets with no chance of reselling.
	different price elasticizes. 
Dumping :
	selling product at low price to foreign countries and higher prices in domestic market


# Monopolistic competition

firms have competition but each one sells a slightly different product.
many small businesses come under this. Like restaurants, each have different dishes but essentially trying for the same customer.
1. There are large numbers of producers or sellers
2. It deals with differentiated products. 
3. There are free entry and exit of firms to the markets. 
4. The selling cost determines the demand for the products. 
5. There is no association of firms 
6) There is no price competition. 
7) There is lack of knowledge of the market.

# Economic inefficiency by monopoly

	paying price higher than MC means loss of consumer welfare.

Consumer’s surplus is the surplus of price which consumers are prepared to pay for a commodity rather than go without it over and above what they actually pay for it.

![[Pasted image 20241114034504.png]]
Dead weight loss is cash flow that is lost. because of higher price demand is decreased.

# Oligopoly
oligo + poly few to sell 

few producers making homogenous or differentiated products.
few firms dominate the market
concentration ratio. market share of 4 largest firms.
few large firms dominating + large number of small firms is still a oligopoly.

## features 

	Interdependece : firms cant take actions indepentedently have to think of what other guy is going to do.
	Stratedy: compete / collude with rivals. raise or lower prices or keep constant. 
	Advertising: life or death for oligopoly 
	due to several determinging factors : demand curve varies a lot
	price rigidity: if price decreased all firms follow, if incresed no one follows. hence bad to do it anyway
	barrier to entry: techonological and legal, patents
	product diffeerentiation: brand value enjoyed by long time players disallowing potential firmms to entry

# kinked demand curve shape of demand curve

	whene products are differentiated, the increase in the price of that product doesn't drive away buyers because they are initimately atteached to that product. 
	Once a price has been determined, it stays at that price due to strategic reseons
	"if price decreased all firms follow, if incresed no one follows. hence bad to do it anyway
	barrier to entry: techonological and legal, patents"

![[Pasted image 20241114021208.png]]

Price is determined at the point of kink. also marginal revenue which is slope of revenue is indeterminate here.

![[Pasted image 20241114022115.png]]
(the bottom sloped line extends vertically downwards after Q)
profits are made since AC < price. equilibrium price is attained by MC = MR


## Collusive and Non collusive oligopoly
	Collusive : 
		Cartel: formal group of producers, or buyers that fix the price and production. 
		OPEC oil and petroleum exporting countries -> largest cartel

		 Price leadership: a firm that is the leader in its sector sets the price and the rivals have to follow suite regardless. competitors can also decresea price in hopes of getting market share as discounters.
		 In this increasing prices increases profitability for all.
		 dominant, barometric, aggresive price leadership


# Economies of scope

degree of scope = (c1 + c2 - c1c2)/c1c2

c1 = cost of producing only one output

large  SC (economies of scope) better.

horizontal and  vertical integration

Double marginalization : When the two firms operate independently, each one exercises its monopoly power by marking up its price above its marginal cost.

Vertical integration avoids double marginalization.

# Break even analysis

total cost = fixed cost + quantity * vairable cost

profit = sales - cost

break even quantity = fixed cost / (price - avg variable cost)
break even price = break even quantity * price

Margin of safetly = actual sales - break even sales
						= profit/contribution * sales

# Macroeconomics
a) Gross Domestic Product : Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of all currently produced final goods and services evaluated at market prices. Some aspects of this definition require clarification.
b) Gross National Product :Gross National Product (GNP) is the total value of all the goods and services produced by a country's economy in a specific time period, usually a year. It includes the income a country receives from abroad and excludes income paid to foreigners.

GNP = GDP+ Net factor Income from abroad

c) Net national product (NNP) : is the monetary value of a country's finished goods and services produced by its citizens, both domestically and overseas, during a given period. It's calculated by subtracting depreciation from the gross national product (GNP) 

NNP= GNP-Depreciation (Depreciation

d) Net Domestic Product (NDP) : GDP-Depreciation

e) NNP at market price: Net National Product (NNP) at market price is a key measure of a country's economic
output that assesses the total value of goods and services produced by its residents. It's calculated by adjusting
the Gross National Product (GNP) by adding indirect taxes and subtracting subsidies.

Nominal gross domestic product is GDP that is evaluated at the present market prices

Real GDP is an inflation-adjusted calculation that analyses the rate of all commodities and services manufactured in a country for a fixed year. It is expressed in foundation year prices and referred to as a fixed cost price.

GDP deflator = ( nominal / real ) * 100

National Income at Current Price  ( nominal national income) and national income at fixed price (real national income).


## Measurement of national income

net output method : sum of goods and services produced by all the firms in a fixed time.
	Estimation of net value added: Gross value of output can be measured by multiplying goods produced by the firms by their market prices
	Estimation of net factor income from abroad: GDP + income of citizens from foreign countries - income paid to foreigners
Income method: factors of production land labor entrepreneur capital The factors receive payments both in cash and kind.
		Identification of production units and classifying them into industrial sectors:
		Classification of factor incomes: 
Expenditure method : It measures national income by computing final expenditure on gross domestic product by households, government and private sector.
	
	National Income = C (household consumption) + G (government expenditure) + I (investment expense) + NX (net exports).
 
# Inflation

decline in purchasing power of money over time.
1. It is a long-term process.
2. It is a state of disequilibrium.
3. It is scarcity oriented.
4. It is dynamic in nature.
5. It is a post full employment phenomenon.
6. It is a purely monetary phenomenon.
7. Inflationary price rise is persistent and irreversible.
8. Inflation is caused by excess demand in relation to supply of all types of goods and services.
9. Inflation involves a process of the persistent rise in prices. It involves rising trend in price level.

Deflation : opposite of inflation. brings about depression phase in economy. 
Disinflation : lowering prices to fight inflation through antiinflaitionary methods that don't cause unemployment, reduction in output.

staglfation : increasing prices with increasing unemployment.

# Types of inflation

Comprehensive inflation: all
Sporadic inflation: only some
war time inflation:
post war time inflation:
peace time inflation:

Open inflation and suppressed inflation
suppressed inflation leads to corruption black marketing and artificial scarcity.

creeping inflation (< 3 %)

chronic inflation if creeping inflation persists for a long time it becomes chronic inflation. it can be continuous or intermittent, could become hyperinflation

walking inflation ( > 3 % and < 10 %)

moderate inflation ( < 10 %)

running inflation ( 10 - 20 %)

galloping( > 20 and < 1000 %) 

hyperinflation ( > 1000 %)


Types:

Deficit inflation: due to deficit financing spending more than earning
credit inflation: due to excessive bank credits or money supply in economy
scarcity inflation: due to hoarding demand rises and supply falls.
profit inflation : when entrepreneurs try to maximize profit.
pricing power inflation: oligopolies and gov have power to dictate price. decreasing value of money
tax inflation: due to indirect taxes sellers increase price of products.
fiscal inflation: fiscal deficit
development inflation: due to increasing incomes there is price increases.

Foriegn trade inflation: 
	export bloom inflation : increase in export leaves less produce in domestic market and hence price increase.
	import bloom inflation :
Demand full inflation :  rising income and rise in population increases demand and increase price of goods and services.
cost push inflation : when prices increase due to growning cost of production in called cost push inflation.

REAL INCOME  = NOMINAL INCOME / PRICE LEVEL
